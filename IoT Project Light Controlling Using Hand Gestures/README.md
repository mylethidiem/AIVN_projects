# IoT Project Light Controlling Using Hand Guestures

Steps:
## Step 1: Preparing data and environment
1.1 Using Conda with Python 3.10
- Create new environment with Python 3.10:
```bash
conda create -n gesture_env python=3.10.0
```
- Activate environment:
```bash
conda activate gesture_env
```

1.2 Install libraries from requirements.txt
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Step 2: Building and training a hand gesture classification model

## Step 3: Implement model and control lights with hand gestures
