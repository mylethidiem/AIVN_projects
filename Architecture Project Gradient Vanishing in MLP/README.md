# Architecture Project Gradient Vanishing in MLP

Steps:
1. Prepare dataset
2. Build MLP network
3. Training
4. Evaluation


We will implement code that implements improved methods to mitigate the Vanishing gradient problem in the baseline model:
1. Weight inscreasing
2. Better Activation
3. Better Optimizer
4. Normalize Inside Network
5. Skip Connection
6. Train Layers Separately
7. Gradient Normalization
